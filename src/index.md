## Web Application Developer

I'm a Software Engineer who is at home anywhere in a project from the API to the UX. I enjoy diving deep into problems as part of a team and coming up with solutions that weigh the tradeoffs and commit to the best path forward.

My goal is to find a position that allows me to creatively solve problems and share my experience while continuing to learn and grow as a developer and person.

I've been happy using all flavors of JavaScript to build software for the last 15+ years, but I'm open to any technology that allows me to create exceptional user experiences. I believe no detail is too small to try and get right. I've worked as a member of a distributed team for over 10 years and pride myself on my teamwork and diligent written and verbal communication. My super power is the ability to fully understand complex systems, and distill my thoughts into actions that I can share to ensure the best technical decision is made and documented.

Above all, I believe that software is about people.
