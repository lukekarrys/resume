## Web Application Developer

I'm a web app developer who is at home anywhere in a project from the API to the UX. I enjoy diving deep into problems as part of a team and coming up with solutions that weigh all the tradeoffs and commit to the best path forward.

My goal is to find a position that allows me to be creative and share my experience while continuing to learn and grow as a developer and person.

I'm happy with React and Node for building great web apps, but I'm open to any technology that allows me to create exceptional user experiences. I believe no detail is too small to try and get right. I've worked as a member of a distributed team for over 8 years and pride myself on my teamwork and diligent written and verbal communication.

Above all, I believe that software is about people.
